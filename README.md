# Data Scientist Marathon

## First part: Excel âœ…
### Completed in 22-26 September.
Here the key aspect I learnt

* Cleaning Data
* Making Chart
* Making pivot table
* Handling Special cases of if-else
* scrap out information using left,right,middle
* Concatenating data
* VLookup table: to smartly describe the abbreviation or something like that
* Cell referencing:
    * Relative referencing 
        * C12
    * Absolute referencing
        * $C12 - Column C is absolute
        * C$12 - Row 12 is absolute

## Second part: Statistics ðŸš§
### Standard Deviation

**For a Population:**
Standard deviation, denoted as sigma (Ïƒ), is calculated using the formula:

    Ïƒ = sqrt( Î£ (xi - Î¼)Â² / N )

Where:
- Ïƒ (sigma): Population standard deviation
- N: Size of the population
- xi: Each value from the population
- Î¼ (mu): The population mean

**For a Sample:**
Sample standard deviation, denoted as s, is calculated as:

    s = sqrt( Î£ (xi - xÌ„)Â² / (n - 1) )

Where:
- s: Sample standard deviation
- n: Size of the sample
- xi: Each value from the sample
- xÌ„ (x-bar): The sample mean


### Covariance

Covariance between two variables X and Y is calculated using the formula:

    cov(X, Y) = Î£ ((xi - xÌ„) * (yi - È³)) / (n - 1)

Where:
- cov(X, Y): Represents the covariance between X and Y
- xi, yi: Are the individual data points
- xÌ„, È³: Are the means of X and Y respectively
- n: Is the number of data points.


### Correlation

The Pearson correlation coefficient, denoted as r, between two variables X and Y is calculated using the formula:

    r = (n * Î£(xy) - Î£x * Î£y) / sqrt( [n * Î£xÂ² - (Î£x)Â²] * [n * Î£yÂ² - (Î£y)Â²] )
    r = cov(X, Y) / (Ïƒx * Ïƒy)

Where:
- r: Is the correlation coefficient, representing the strength and direction of the linear relationship between X and Y.
- n: Is the number of paired data points.
- Î£xy: Is the sum of the product of each pair of values.
- Î£x and Î£y: Are the sums of the X and Y values, respectively.
- Î£xÂ² and Î£yÂ²: Are the sums of the squared X and Y values, respectively.

This coefficient r ranges from -1 to 1, inclusive:
- r = 1 implies a perfect positive linear relationship.
- r = -1 implies a perfect negative linear relationship.
- r = 0 implies no linear relationship.

### Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' Theorem is used to find the probability of a hypothesis given the prior knowledge. It is articulated as:

    P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \): is the probability of hypothesis \( A \) given the data \( B \).
- \( P(B|A) \): is the probability of the data \( B \) given that the hypothesis \( A \) was true.
- \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \): are the probabilities of hypothesis \( A \) and data \( B \) respectively.
